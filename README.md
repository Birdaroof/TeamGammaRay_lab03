## Hypothesis:
Binary search will be a lot faster than linear search on average. This is because it takes the "savviest" guesses, and will take fewer guesses on average than linear search, which brute forces, and iterates through every element in an array. 

Linear search will be faster if the target element is very close to the beginning.
Binary search will be slowest if the target element is the first or last element of the array. 
Linear search will be slowest if the target element is the last element of the array, or if it doesn't exist. 

## Results: 



## Conclusion: 

Binary search on average is a lot faster than linear search, most of the time returning a value of 0 milliseconds for search time. 
Linear search on the other hand is very inefficient, making runtimes very long, and consuming a lot of memory.
