12/17/21 12:00 PM
  - Reviewed and updated plan

  - Created methods to populate arrays, test times, fill out result arrays, and find average time
  - Created 6 test cases of arrays with varying length.
  - Jun Hong suggested creating a print method
  - Created a print method
  - Java ran out of heap space
  - Jomin suggested that the array was too big
12/20/21 12:00 PM
  - Updated methods
  - Kevin suggested that print method was making the file take too long to compile and run

  - Updated linear search so that it always searches for the worst case scenario thanks to QAF traffic clarifying.
  - Created a for loop for linear and binary search so that they iterate the same process through array multiple times to produce visible results in binary.
  This circumvents the space issue you get from creating large arrays.
  - Our loop iterates binary search 10,000 times and linear search 10 times, linear search still being way slower than binary search. (We couldn't iterate
  linear search 10,000 or else our program simply overloaded and didn't run).
  - Added Hypothesis, Tests Performed, Results, and Conclusions to our Readme File.
